# Automat 2020

Automat gathers YouTube likes, picture of the day from NASA, new content from defined RSS channel, tweets of certain user or new Instagram posts in one place.  
I use paid service [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) for that.

Automat is a child theme of the [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) theme.
